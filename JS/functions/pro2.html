        JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword. You can use a function declaration or a function expression.

        Function Declarations

        Earlier in this tutorial, you learned that functions are declared with the following syntax:
        function functionName(parameters) {
            // code to be executed
        }

        Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).

    (function findCube(x){
       console.log(x * x * x);
    })(5);
