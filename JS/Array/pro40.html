        JavaScript Array toSpliced()
        ES2023 added the Array toSpliced() method as a safe way to splice an array without altering the original array.
        
        The difference between the new toSpliced() method and the old splice() method is that the new method creates a new array, keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array.

    const fruits1 = ["Apple", "Mango","Kiwi", "Lichi","Banana", "Orange"];
    
    console.log(fruits1);
    // splice(start index, number of element to delete, new values)
    const fruits2 = fruits1.toSpliced(2, 3);
    console.log(fruits2);
