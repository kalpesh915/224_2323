        Many languages allows negative bracket indexing like [-1] to access elements from the end of an object / array / string.
        This is not possible in JavaScript, because [] is used for accessing both arrays and objects. obj[-1] refers to the value of key -1, not to the last property of the object.
        The at() method was introduced in ES2022 to solve this problem.
