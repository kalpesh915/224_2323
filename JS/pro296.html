        The let and const Keywords
        Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialied.
        Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared. Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError. The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:

    username = "Bhavya";

    document.write("Welcome "+username);

    const username; // must assign value while create const variable in JS
